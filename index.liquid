            With Polaroid Cloud, you can sync your photos to your favorite cloud service while still enjoying the instant printing youâ€™ve come to expect from Polaroid. 
            Using our special instant photo paper, your image is uploaded to the web and a QR code is generated and printed with the instant photo. 
            Perfect for sharing with your friends and family.
